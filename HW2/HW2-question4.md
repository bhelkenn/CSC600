Ran with n = 2^28 - 1 and K = 1

On battery and plugged in, iterative took roughly 25 sec; recursive took about 0.7 sec longer than iterative.

I don't think there is a significant difference in the performance between them, according to my test.

That said, recursive took longer to perform function calls as overhead that iterative didn't have.
